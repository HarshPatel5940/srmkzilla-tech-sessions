# INTRO TO JS SESSION TASKS

Below are the tasks which you people need to complete ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥ before deadline.

**Task Deadline: 22nd October ( Saturday ), 2022 (by 3pm afternoon)**

## Initialization Tasks

1. Create a github repository, called `"srmkzilla-tech-sessions"`.
2. Create a main and another branch with the name something like `intro-to-js`.

## In that , do the following tasks.

1. Create function.js where you have to define two functions, one the traditional js function and
   then a fat arrow function. Perform string manipulation or array manipulation or anything that you
   want, but make sure you use functions and call them. Also have some required and optional
   paramters.

2. Create another file, write a function there and export it and import it in the first file. It could be
   anything, maybe prime number finder. It checks whether a number passed is prime or not.
   (Don't use this example, use some other example).

3. Declare an array containing numbers, pass that array to a function and add n to every
   element. Let's say you have an array [1, 3 , 7]. Pass this array to a function, and pass n, which
   can be any integer. Now, return another array from the function which adds n to every element.
   So if n is 2, the new array is [3, 5, 9].

4. Array: take an array of string and store 10 names inside it. Use map, filter and forEach to get
   an array of names whose length is less than 6.

Hope you guys were able to gain something knowledgeable from the session ðŸ’»

Happy hacking:))
